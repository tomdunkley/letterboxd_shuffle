# letterboxd_shuffle
Play a random movie from a list in one of your saved services.

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.8

pywin32

pywinauto



#### Note: this probably won't work for you. It's designed, at the moment, with all the settings for my laptop and for google chrome. The infrastructure is all there though if you want to change some numbers and try to get it working.

## To use:

Set RESOULUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y

Go to a letterboxd list in Chrome

Select filters - for best results set "SERVICE" to "Stream Only" and "Sort By" to "Shuffle"

With the chrome window open and the refresh button visible, run random_movie.py

Wait for the windows error tone

Enjoy a random movie
